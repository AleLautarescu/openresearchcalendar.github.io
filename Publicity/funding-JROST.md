The Open Research Calendar (ORC - https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/) is a community developed and powered shared calendar to keep track of open research events. 
The calendar facilitates advertisement and attendance of numerous open research events, and provides researchers with a straightforward and efficient service. 
In the 8 months since its launch, the Open Research Calendar has reached over 500 followers and has had 100+ event submissions, showing a real need for this tool in the community. 
This tool is administered by a small group of volunteers, and currently runs on very limited funding and volunteer donations, which are needed to maintain the current functionalities. 

The goal of the Open Research Calendar is to serve the global research community by increasing the visibility and accessibility of open research events. 
However, its worldwide operability is currently hampered by the fact that calendar events are displayed in local (GMT) time, which requires users outside of the United Kingdom to manually convert each event to UK time. We would need funding to consult a research software developer to provide a solution to our current time zone conversion issue. 

Secondly, the Open Research Calendar aims to democratise access to knowledge, and ensure that information regarding open research events reaches a wider and more diverse audience. 
This is particularly important in the context of an increasing number of events being organised and hosted on online platforms. 
However, the tool currently has limited impact, as the calendar only notifies those that have added the Open Research Calendar to their own Google Calendar or people who have a Twitter account. 
To increase the visibility of the calendar we would need a monthly mailing list that provides an overview of upcoming events. 
To be able to allow the community to contribute to this process and to automate it as much as possible, we would again need expert advice. 

We estimate that a consultation with an expert would cost $500, with a total of $2500 needed if we would like the developer to implement the solutions. 

**What deliverables or outcomes would these funds ensure / enable?**

Thanks to the funding we would have (1) a calendar on the website that would allow for user friendly time zone conversion, (2) a workflow to add events in the time zone that the user is in, (3) and a monthly email list with the updates for the next month that is automated and allows contributions by the wider community. 
The funding would allow us to elevate the tool infrastructure and improve the user experience, ensuring that the Open Research Calendar can become a truly global community-powered shared calendar. 
We believe that lowering the barriers for users to participate in events and for event organisers to share their events with the world will help further the open research movement and its goals of transparency and openness.

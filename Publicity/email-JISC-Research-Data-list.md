Dear all, 

If you are interested in Open Research events, or if you are hosting events, please consider to use the **Open Research Calendar**. 
The Open Research Calendar is a community tool that aims to collate worldwide open research events into one database. 
This increases the visibility of Open Research events and it provides an overview that individuals can easily navigate to select events that they wish to attend. 
The events are visible through a [Google Calendar](https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/calendar), which can be synced into your own personal calendar. 
Anyone can contribute to the Open Research Calendar by entering information about events through the website: https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/add-event. 

We have recently updated the form to add events to the calendar and we would welcome any feedback you have on adding events, or any other aspects of the calendar. 
We also welcome contributions to the technical development of the calendar: The code and documentation are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/openresearchcalendar/openresearchcalendar.github.io).

You can learn more about the calendar on the website: https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/ or follow the calendar on Twitter: https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal.

On behalf of the Open Research Calendar Team, 

Esther

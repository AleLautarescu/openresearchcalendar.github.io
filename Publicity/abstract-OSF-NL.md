**Short description that summarizes the presentation, its rationale and relevance for the National Open Science Festival:**

The Open Research Calendar ([@openresearchcal](https://twitter.com/openresearchcal)) is a community tool that aims to collate worldwide open research events into one database. 
This increases the visibility of these events and it provides an overview that individuals can easily navigate to select events that they wish to attend. 
The events are visible through a [Google Calendar](http://tinyurl.com/OpenResearchCal), which can be synced into a person’s own personal calendar. 
Anyone can contribute to the Open Research Calendar by entering information about events in a [Google form](http://tinyurl.com/New-Event). 
In order for the Open Research Calendar events to be representative of occuring events and to become a tool of the Open Research community, we need to raise awareness and invite people to contribute their events to the calendar. 
We also welcome contributions to the development of the Calendar. 
This is why we would like to highlight the tool during the marketplace session of the Dutch National Open Science Festival.

**Materials that are brought by the presenter:**

- Poster or banner
- Small cards to hand out with QR codes to the calendar

**Requirements for the session (screens, set up of tables, flipcharts, etc.)**

NB: we cannot guarantee that we have everything available for you
If possible, a screen to demonstrate the calendar itself and the google form that people should use to contribute to the calendar.

The [Open Research Calendar](https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/) ([@openresearchcal](https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal)) is a community tool that aims to collate worldwide open research events into one database. 
This increases the visibility of these events and it provides an overview that individuals can easily navigate to select events that they wish to attend. 
The events are visible through a [Google Calendar](https://openresearchcalendar.github.io/calendar), which can be synced into a personâ€™s own personal calendar. 
Anyone can contribute to the Open Research Calendar by entering information about events in a [Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdGKfOrxs-bS-CF7ppTzQuVzZs7dzU-zYQ2GHvo1PNEmXmX4Q/closedform). 
The added event will then be added to the calendar and promoted through [Twitter]((https://twitter.com/OpenResearchCal)). 
We also welcome contributions to the technical development of the Calendar: 
The code and documentation for the Calendar are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/openresearchcalendar/openresearchcalendar.github.io) (GNU 3.0 licence, allowing groups to recreate the automation and communication features for their own communities).
You can also [request an Open Research Calendar sticker](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSemzXy9XdL5oCDzlNkqnBfUY3kn3AEe8fxPVAe7YKzC_TMyPg/viewform)!
